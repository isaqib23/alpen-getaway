# Alpen Getaway - Ride Booking Admin System

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a comprehensive ride booking admin panel with an integrated auction system where B2B companies can bid on confirmed bookings. The project consists of a **NestJS backend** (port 3000) and a **React TypeScript frontend** (port 5173 for client dev server).

### Architecture
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeORM, PostgreSQL, JWT auth, Swagger docs
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Material-UI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive tables for bookings, auctions, users, etc.
- **API Structure**: RESTful with `/api/v1/` prefix
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with localStorage token management

## 🚫 DISABLED MODULES (For Later Development)

The following sections are **temporarily disabled** in `App.tsx` to focus on core functionality:

### 1. Financial Management (DISABLED)
- Routes: `/financial/payments`, `/financial/commissions`, `/financial/payment-methods`
- Pages: `Payments.tsx`, `Commissions.tsx`, `PaymentMethods.tsx`
- Status: Imports and routes commented out

### 2. Reviews & Ratings (DISABLED)
- Routes: `/reviews`, `/reviews/pending`, `/reviews/approved`, `/reviews/rejected`
- Pages: `AllReviews.tsx`, `PendingReviews.tsx`, `ApprovedReviews.tsx`, `RejectedReviews.tsx`
- Status: Imports and routes commented out

### 3. Content Management (DISABLED)
- Routes: `/cms/pages`, `/cms/blog`, `/cms/help`, `/cms/legal`
- Pages: `CMSPages.tsx`, `BlogPosts.tsx`, `HelpPages.tsx`, `LegalPages.tsx`
- Status: Imports and routes commented out

### 4. System Settings (DISABLED)
- Route: `/settings`
- Page: `SystemSettings.tsx`
- Status: Imports and routes commented out

**To Re-enable**: Uncomment the imports and routes in `/client/src/App.tsx`

## 🏗️ CURRENT WORKING ARCHITECTURE

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User visits protected route → Redirect to /auth/login
2. Login form submission → useAuth hook → authAPI.login()
3. Success → Store JWT token → Navigate to /dashboard
4. All subsequent requests → Include JWT in headers
5. Token validation → localStorage cleanup if invalid
```

### Data Flow (Current Implementation)
```
Auth Pages: Real API Integration
└── useAuth hook → authAPI → Backend JWT validation

Auction Pages: Mock Data (API Ready)
└── Local state → Mock data → Simulated loading states

Other Admin Pages: Basic UI Structure
└── Component rendering → No API integration yet
```

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Authentication**: Full JWT implementation with token management
2. **Auction System**: Mock data for UI development, real backend ready
3. **Module Strategy**: Disable complex modules until core is solid
4. **UI Framework**: Material-UI for consistency
5. **State Management**: React hooks pattern, no Redux needed yet
6. **TypeScript**: Full type safety across all components

## 💾 SESSION MEMORY FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

### Recent Migrations Completed
1. **Auth System Migration** (Dec 2024):
   - Moved from empty placeholders to full implementations
   - Source: `/client/src/pages-old/auth/` → `/client/src/pages/auth/`
   - Included: Login, ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, NotFound
   - Status: Fully functional with Material-UI and API integration

2. **Module Disabling** (Dec 2024):
   - Disabled financial, reviews, content, settings modules in App.tsx
   - Reason: Focus on core functionality first
   - Method: Commented out imports and routes with clear labels

### Key Files to Remember
- **App.tsx**: Main routing configuration with disabled modules clearly marked
- **useAuth hook**: Complete authentication state management
- **AuthLayout**: Reusable layout for auth pages
- **Auction pages**: Working with mock data, ready for API integration
- **CLAUDE.md**: This file - always update after major changes

### Development Workflow
1. **Start with auth** - login system is working
2. **Focus on core modules** - users, bookings, fleet, auctions
3. **Add API integration** - replace mock data with real APIs
4. **Re-enable disabled modules** - uncomment in App.tsx when ready
5. **Update this file** - document all major changes for future sessions

### Mock Data Locations (For API Integration Later)
- `AuctionManagement.tsx`: `mockAuctions` array + `mockStats`
- `ActiveAuctions.tsx`: `mockActiveAuctions` array
- `AuctionAnalytics.tsx`: `mockAnalyticsAuctions` array

### Technical Debt to Address
1. Replace auction mock data with real API calls
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add loading skeletons for better UX
4. Implement real-time WebSocket connections
5. Add comprehensive testing suite

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED IN NEW SESSION

1. **Verify Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd client && npm run dev  # Should start on port 5173
   cd server && npm run start:dev  # Should start on port 3000
   ```

2. **Test Authentication**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173
   - Should redirect to login
   - Use admin@alpengetaway.com / admin123456
   - Should redirect to dashboard

3. **Check Current Status**:
   - Review this CLAUDE.md file
   - Check App.tsx for disabled modules
   - Test auction pages with mock data

4. **Continue Development**:
   - Pick next priority from roadmap above
   - Update this file with any major changes
   - Maintain focus on core features before re-enabling disabled modules

**Remember**: This project has a solid foundation with working auth and auction backend. The strategy is to perfect core features before adding complexity.
