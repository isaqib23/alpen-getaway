# 📘 B2B Dashboard Planning & Analysis

## 🎯 Project Context
Building a B2B User Dashboard that allows B2B partners to log in and access their own data, separate from the admin environment. This system will provide company-specific access to bookings, auctions, earnings, and fleet management.

---

## ✅ Analysis Complete - Current Admin Panel Structure

### 🏗️ Authentication System
- **JWT-based authentication** with localStorage token management
- **Role-based access control** via `user.user_type` (CUSTOMER, B2B_PARTNER, AFFILIATE, DRIVER, ADMIN)
- **Existing B2B layout component** at `client/src/components/layout/B2BPartnerLayout.tsx`
- **Auth API endpoints** support all user types via `/api/v1/auth/*`

### 🗄️ Data Models & Filtering Requirements

#### Core Entities with B2B Context:
1. **Users**: `user_type: B2B_PARTNER` identifies B2B users
2. **Companies**: Each B2B user has a linked company record via `user_id`
3. **Bookings**: Filtered by `company_id` for B2B partner bookings
4. **Auctions**: B2B companies can bid on bookings via auction system
5. **Drivers**: B2B companies manage their own driver pool
6. **Cars**: B2B companies manage their own fleet
7. **Payments/Commissions**: Earnings and payouts filtered by company

#### Key Filtering Patterns:
- **Company-scoped data**: Filter by `company_id` or `user.company.id`
- **Booking access**: Only bookings where `company_id` matches logged-in user's company
- **Fleet management**: Cars and drivers owned by the B2B company
- **Financial data**: Commissions, payouts, and earnings for the company

## 🔍 Reusable Components & Logic

### ✅ Can Be Reused (95% compatibility):
1. **Layout System**: 
   - `B2BPartnerLayout.tsx` already exists with partner-specific navigation
   - Material-UI components and styling
   - Responsive design patterns

2. **API Client Infrastructure**:
   - `apiClient` with JWT token management
   - All existing API endpoints support company filtering
   - Error handling and request/response patterns

3. **Form Components**:
   - Booking forms, driver management, car management
   - Validation patterns with Formik + Yup
   - Material-UI form components

4. **Chart & Analytics Components**:
   - Dashboard charts for earnings, booking trends
   - Performance metrics visualization
   - Export functionality

5. **Data Tables**:
   - Booking lists, driver lists, car lists
   - Pagination, sorting, filtering
   - Export and bulk actions

### 🔧 Needs Adaptation:
1. **Navigation Structure**: Filter menu items relevant to B2B partners
2. **Data Filtering**: Add company-scope filters to all data fetching
3. **Permission Checks**: Ensure B2B users can only access their company data
4. **Dashboard Metrics**: Show company-specific KPIs instead of system-wide

### 🛠️ Needs New Development:
1. **Company Profile Management**: Edit company details, contact info
2. **Bid Management Interface**: View available auctions, place bids
3. **Earnings Dashboard**: Revenue tracking, payout requests
4. **Performance Analytics**: Company-specific metrics and reporting

## 🏛️ B2B Dashboard Architecture Plan

### 📍 Route Structure
```
/partner/dashboard         - Company overview & metrics
/partner/bookings         - Company's booking history
/partner/bookings/active  - Current active bookings
/partner/auctions         - Available auctions to bid on
/partner/auctions/bids    - Company's bid history
/partner/fleet           - Company's car management
/partner/drivers         - Company's driver management
/partner/earnings        - Revenue & payout tracking
/partner/analytics       - Performance metrics
/partner/profile         - Company profile settings
/partner/support         - Help & support
```

### 🔐 Authentication Flow
1. **Login**: Same login endpoint (`/api/v1/auth/login`)
2. **Role Check**: Verify `user.user_type === 'B2B_PARTNER'`
3. **Company Context**: Load user's company via `user.company` relationship
4. **Route Protection**: Redirect non-B2B users to appropriate dashboard

### 📊 Data Access Patterns
```typescript
// Example: Company-scoped booking fetching
const getCompanyBookings = async (filters: BookingFilters) => {
  const user = getCurrentUser()
  return bookingsAPI.getBookings({
    ...filters,
    company_id: user.company.id  // Auto-inject company filter
  })
}
```

### 🎨 UI/UX Approach
1. **Reuse Admin Components**: 95% code reuse with company filtering
2. **Simplified Navigation**: Focus on B2B-relevant modules only
3. **Company Branding**: Show company name/logo in header
4. **Quick Stats Sidebar**: Revenue, active bookings, pending bids

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### API Modifications Required:
- **Minimal**: Most endpoints already support company filtering
- **Add middleware**: Auto-inject company context for B2B users
- **New endpoints**: Company profile updates, bid submissions

### Security Considerations:
- **Data isolation**: Strict company-scoped data access
- **Permission validation**: Server-side checks for company ownership
- **Audit trails**: Log all B2B user actions

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Lazy loading**: Load modules on-demand
- **Caching**: Company-specific data caching
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket integration for auctions
